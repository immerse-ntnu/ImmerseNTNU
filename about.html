                <h2> What Immerse does</h2>
                <h3> Tomorrows game developers</h3>
                <p>
                    This is the initial overview of Immerse as an organization.
                    And will present the main idea of how you can learn game development as a “learn-by-doing” stepwise process through creating your own video games in the Unity environment.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The purpose of the section is not to be exhaustive, but just enough to trigger visitor‘s interest and clarify the purpose of Immerse.

                <p>
                    "Who Immerse are for” will clarify what kind of personnel Immerse are aiming for.
                    This is done by describing the necessary competencies before enrolling, what fields of interest Immerse are fulfilling, and the general life situation.
                    For example the necessary competence will be summarized as <br>

                    “It is sufficient with basic knowledge of a programming language, for example the knowledge gained from ITGK in Python.
                    In general you are fulfilling the requirements as long as you understand how a computer performs actions”.

                <h2>What Immerse offers</h2>
                <h3>What you can expect from enrolling at immerse</h3>
                <p>
                    Section “What you can expect from enrolling at immerse” is the main information in the about page.
                    Here the visitor will be presented with the idea of a semester based course,
                    where you enroll with only basic knowledge of computers and gradually work your way through pre-defined projects,
                    gaining new skills in game development.
                    There will be some text describing the journey,
                    but the explanation shall happen through a figure/model which shows each semester/step and explains what kind of project you will do and what you will learn.
                    This ensures a visual, easy to understand presentation of the Immerse pipeline.
