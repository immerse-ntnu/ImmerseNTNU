                Immerseâ€™s goal is to create a community where everyone can learn from each other and get
                together to
                create
                something they want to make. We want to become an organization known for their talented members.

                How does Immerse work?
            </h2>
            <p>In your first semester you will acquire the skills to start making games. You will learn about
                the
                Unity
                game engine, the C# programming language and how to work as a team using github. You will also
                create
                some
                smaller games.</p>
            <hr>
                <p>
                Starting your second semester you become a junior developer and will work on a larger
                game
                with some supervision. You will also help members in their first semester.
            </p>
            <hr>
            <p>When you no longer need
                supervision you will become a senior, aka someone who supervises junior developers.</p>
