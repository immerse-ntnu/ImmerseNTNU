    <h2>We don't create games</h2>
    <h3>We create developers</h3>
    <p>
        Immerseâ€™s goal is to create a community where everyone can learn from each other and get together to
        create something they want to make. We want to become an organization known for its talented members.

    <h2>How does Immerse work?</h2>
    <p>In your first semester you will acquire the skills to start making games. You will learn about the
        Unity game engine, the C# programming language, and how to work as a team using Github. You will also
        create some smaller games.
    </p>
    <hr>
    <p>
        Starting your second semester you become a junior developer and will work on a larger game with some
        supervision. You will also help members in their first semester.
    </p>
    <hr>
    <p>
        When you no longer need supervision you will become a senior, aka someone who supervises junior developers.
